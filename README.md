## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build classifiers and regressors from scratch, providing a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of machine learning algorithms. While using Python for implementation, the emphasis is on the algorithms themselves rather than relying on existing libraries.

## Algorithms Covered

### Classification
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression

### Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Elastic Net
- Polynomial Regression
## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the Python files in the `classifiers` and `regressors` directories
4. Run tests using `pytest` (if implemented)

## Implementation Details

Each algorithm is implemented from scratch, focusing on the core mathematical and logical concepts. While Python is used for coding, the implementations avoid relying on high-level machine learning libraries for the actual algorithm logic.

## Contributing

Contributions, suggestions, and discussions about algorithm implementations are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
