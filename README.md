### Lab 1: Autocollimator

**1. What is an autocollimator and what principle does it work on?**\
An autocollimator is a precision optical instrument used to measure small angular differences. It works on the principle of reflection and collimation of light. A collimated beam of light (parallel light beam) is projected onto a reflective surface and the reflected beam is observed through a telescope or sensor. Any angular displacement causes a shift in the reflected image, which can be measured accurately.

**2. How does the autocollimator measure straightness of a surface plate?**\
By placing a mirror or reflector on different positions along the surface plate and measuring the angular deviation at each point, the autocollimator detects bends or deviations from a straight line.

**3. Why is a standard straight edge used in this experiment?**\
The straight edge provides a known reference to compare against the test surface. It helps in identifying deviations of the surface plate from ideal flatness.

**4. How do you interpret the deflection readings in terms of straightness?**\
Deflection readings are converted into height differences using trigonometric relationships, which can be plotted to visualize the straightness of the surface.

**5. What factors affect the sensitivity of an autocollimator?**

- Focal length of the optical system
- Quality of collimation
- Type of sensor used
- Distance between the autocollimator and the reflector.

**6. What do positive and negative cumulative values in the data indicate?**\
Positive values indicate upward deviation, while negative values show downward deviation from the reference straight line.

**1. What is a capstan lathe and how is it different from a conventional lathe?**\
A capstan lathe is a semi-automatic lathe equipped with a turret tool post that allows for sequential operations using different tools. Unlike conventional lathes, it is optimized for batch production, quick small scale operations and rapid tool indexing.

**2. What are the advantages of a capstan lathe in production?**\
High productivity, reduced cycle time, ability to perform multiple operations without resetting, and better repeatability.

**3. What is the role of the turret in a capstan lathe?**\
It holds multiple tools and rotates to bring each tool into position quickly, minimizing tool change time.

**4. How does indexing of tools in a capstan lathe occur?**\
Manually or automatically, the turret rotates to bring the next tool into working position using a ratchet mechanism.

**5. What are the types of indexing in a turret lathe?**\


- Manual indexing: Operator manually rotates the turret to align the desired tool.
- Automatic indexing: The turret rotates automatically to the next tool position, typically after the carriage returns.
- Geneva mechanism indexing: Uses a Geneva wheel to precisely rotate the turret at fixed intervals.

**6. Why is cycle time reduced in turret operations?**\
No need to change tools manually between operations; all tools are pre-mounted and indexed sequentially.

**7. Name some typical operations performed on a capstan lathe.**\
Facing, turning, drilling, reaming, threading, and knurling.

- Turning shapes the external cylindrical surfaces of a rotating workpiece.
- Drilling creates a new cylindrical hole.

Least count is the smallest measurable value an instrument can read. It defines the resolution and affects accuracy.

**5. How is the least count of an instrument calculated?**\


- **For a Vernier caliper**: Least Count = (Smallest division on main scale - 1 division on Vernier scale)
- **For a micrometer**: Least Count = Pitch of screw / Number of divisions on the circular scale
- **For a height gauge**: Similar to a Vernier caliper, depends on scale graduations

A micrometer uses a precision screw mechanism. Rotating the thimble moves the spindle toward the anvil. Each full rotation of the thimble moves the spindle by the pitch of the screw. The combination of main scale and rotating scale provides fine resolution.

**8. What is the working principle of a surface roughness tester?**\
A stylus traces the surface, and vertical displacements due to surface irregularities are converted into electrical signals. These are then processed to compute roughness parameters like Ra.

**9. What are the possible sources of error in a measurement setup?**\
Instrument calibration error, parallax error, zero error, backlash in screw mechanisms, environmental conditions (like temperature or vibration), and human error.

### Lab 6: Floating Carriage Micrometer

**1. What is the principle of the floating carriage micrometer?**\
It works by comparing the thread being measured to calibrated cylinders using micrometric readings while maintaining alignment. It allows for accurate measurement of pitch diameter or effective diameter without deforming the thread.

**2. How is effective diameter of a threaded component measured?**\
By using the three-wire method or by measuring over standard cylinders and applying geometric corrections. The effective diameter (also called pitch diameter) is the diameter of an imaginary cylinder that passes through the threads at such points that the widths of the thread ridges and grooves are equal.

**3. Why are standard cylinders used in this setup?**\
They provide reference points to calculate effective diameter indirectly. The use of precision cylinders allows alignment with the thread flanks, making it easier to compute actual dimensions without direct contact with threads.

**4. What are pitch errors and how are they calculated?**\
Deviation in pitch length from nominal value, calculated from cumulative measurements across multiple threads. These errors can be systematic (e.g., tool misalignment) or random due to vibrations or machine inaccuracies.

**5. What is the role of three-wire method in thread measurement?**\
To accurately determine the effective diameter by placing wires in the thread groove and measuring over them. The wire diameter and geometry of the thread are used in formulas to calculate the effective diameter.

**6. What is the p-value in thread measurement, and how is it used?**\
The p-value refers to a correction term applied in the three-wire method. It is derived from the pitch of the thread and the geometry of the wire contact. The formula is:

\(\text{p-value} = \frac{p}{2} \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - d\left(\csc\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - 1\right)\)

Where:

- \(p\): pitch of the thread
- \(\theta\): thread/helix angle (typically 60°)
- \(d\): diameter of the wire used

**7. How is the minor diameter of a thread measured?**\
Minor diameter is measured using a V-anvil micrometer or optical comparator methods. It refers to the smallest diameter inside the thread, crucial for ensuring strength and proper fit.

**8. Why is effective diameter preferred over major or minor diameter in functional thread measurements?**\
Effective diameter best represents the thread’s capability to engage with a mating part, as it accounts for the load-bearing surface where contact occurs during fastening.

### Lab 7: Grinding

**1. What is grinding and why is it considered a finishing operation?**\
Grinding is a material removal process using an abrasive wheel to produce smooth and accurate surfaces. It removes very little material, making it ideal for final finishing.

**2. What are the common types of grinding wheels?**\
Aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, cubic boron nitride (CBN), and diamond wheels.

**3. How does wheel selection affect surface finish?**\
Grit size, bond type, and hardness determine the finish quality—finer grit provides smoother finish.

**4. What is wheel dressing and why is it necessary?**\
Dressing sharpens the wheel and restores its shape. It removes embedded debris and ensures efficient cutting.

**5. What are the typical parameters affecting grinding performance?**\
Wheel speed, feed rate, depth of cut, coolant application, and material hardness.

**6. What is grinding wheel nomenclature?**\
Grinding wheels are identified using a standardized code that describes their properties. The nomenclature typically includes:

- **Abrasive type**: e.g., A (Aluminum oxide), C (Silicon carbide)
- **Grit size**: Number indicating coarseness or fineness (e.g., 24, 46, 60)
- **Grade**: Hardness of the bond (e.g., soft grade H to hard grade Z)
- **Structure**: Density of the abrasive grains (1 = dense, 15 = open)
- **Bond type**: Material holding the abrasive (e.g., V - Vitrified, B - Resinoid)

**Example:** A60K5V

- A: Aluminum oxide abrasive
- 60: Medium grit size
- K: Medium grade
- 5: Medium structure
- V: Vitrified bond

This classification helps users select the right wheel for specific materials and surface finish requirements.

**7. When should a softer grinding wheel be used?**\
A softer wheel should be used when:

- The workpiece material is hard or has high tensile strength
- The grinding area is large or there’s high heat generation
- Low machine power or rigidity is a concern
- The application requires frequent dressing or sharp cutting action

Softer wheels break down faster and expose new, sharp grains, making them ideal for such conditions.

**8. What is the order of softness among common grinding wheel abrasives?**\
From softest to hardest:

1. Aluminum Oxide (A)
2. Silicon Carbide (C)
3. Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN)
4. Diamond

Diamond is the hardest, used for very hard materials like ceramics and carbide. Aluminium oxide is the softest, suited for steels and general-purpose use.---

### Lab 8: Shaper & Planer Machines

**1. What is the basic working principle of a shaper machine?**\
A single-point cutting tool moves linearly across the workpiece to remove material during forward stroke.

**2. How does a planer differ from a shaper?**\
In a planer, the workpiece moves and the tool is stationary; in a shaper, the tool moves and the workpiece is fixed.

**3. What kind of components are best suited for shaping vs. planning?**\
Shaping: Small to medium parts; Planning: Large, heavy components.

**4. Explain the quick return mechanism in a shaper.**\
It reduces the time taken during the return stroke by using unequal rotations or links in the drive mechanism.

**5. What is the function of the clapper box?**\
It allows the tool to lift automatically during return stroke to avoid dragging.

### Lab 9: Tool Wear

**1. What are the different types of tool wear?**\
Flank wear, crater wear, notch wear, nose wear, and built-up edge.

**2. How does flank wear affect machining performance?**\
Increases cutting forces, poor surface finish, and risk of tool failure.

**3. What is crater wear and where does it occur?**\
Occurs on the rake face due to friction with chips and high temperature.

**4. What is built-up edge (BUE), why does it form, and when does it occur?**\
A built-up edge is a layer of workpiece material that adheres to the cutting edge of the tool. It forms due to high pressure and moderate temperature at the cutting zone, which causes the material to weld onto the tool. BUE typically occurs when:
- Machining ductile materials (e.g., mild steel)
- At low to medium cutting speeds
- When lubrication is insufficient
- When the tool is not sharp enough

Though it can temporarily protect the tool from wear, it often leads to poor surface finish and dimensional inaccuracies.

**5. How can tool life be estimated?**\
Using Taylor's tool life equation: VT^n = C, where V is cutting speed, T is tool life.

**6. What are the common causes of tool wear?**\
High temperature, friction, poor lubrication, hard materials, and improper cutting parameters.

**7. What are the signs of tool failure?**\
Increased vibrations, noise, poor surface finish, dimensional errors, and visible cracks or breakage.\
Increased vibrations, noise, poor surface finish, dimensional errors, and visible cracks or breakage.
